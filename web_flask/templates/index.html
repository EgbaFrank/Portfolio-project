            <h2>About GroceryHub</h2>
            <p>
                GroceryHub was inspired by the need to make grocery shopping simpler and more affordable. During my own experience of visiting multiple stores to find the best prices, I realized how inefficient it was. This sparked the idea for a platform that consolidates grocery lists, prices, and stores in one place. 
                <br><br>
                The project began in 2024 as part of my portfolio for Holberton Schoolâ€™s Full-Stack Development program. It has since grown into a comprehensive tool for shoppers to compare prices, manage lists, and find the best deals.
